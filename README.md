# Variables and Operators

In this repository, you will practice variables, arithmetic operators, and primitive data types.

## Objectives

- Use the data types: string, number, boolean, undefined, null.
- Use the following operators: (+) (-) (*) (/) (%).
- Use the keywords: var, const, let.
- Use the operators: (=) (+=) (-=) (*=)(++) (- -).
- Use the operators: (>) (<) (>=) (<=) (== vs ===) (!=).

## Basic Requirements

Complete all of the questions in the `challenges.js` file.

### 1. Open the file in your browser

- Open the `index.html` file.
  - Note where this file connects to the JavaScript file.
  - Open the file in your browser.
  - Open the JavaScript console to see the results of your code.

### 2. Answer all of the challenges

- Answer each question in the challenges file.
- When you are done answering, comment it out!
  - **To comment out a line, use `//` in front of the line, or encapsulate the entire line with `*/ code /*`.**

### 3. Commit early, commit often

- After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
  - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
  - `git add .` adds all files 
  - `git commit -m "MESSAGE"` adds commit message
  - `git push` pushes changes
